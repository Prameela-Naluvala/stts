Hi Paddy, Harshaa,

Please refer the   ExcelReport  for July cost details.

Sheet1 – Cost Increase -> It holds the details of cost for services additions or upgrades in July comparing with June
Sheet 2 – Client-wise cost -> It holds cost for each client
Sheet 3 – xmlvalidator cost -> It holds xmlvalidator total cost and individual cost for all clients

For August till date cost is £15,562.44

Is it okay to share this update with Darren?

Thanks,
Prameela
