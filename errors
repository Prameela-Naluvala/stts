Hi Darren,

I hope you're well.

I've completed the cost analysis for our AWS infrastructure for July, and I wanted to share the details with you. The Excel report attached contains a breakdown of the costs:

Sheet 1 – Cost Increase: This sheet outlines the cost impact of any service additions or upgrades in July compared to June.
Sheet 2 – Client-wise Cost: This sheet provides a detailed view of the costs associated with each client.
Sheet 3 – XML Validator Cost: This sheet includes both the total cost and the individual costs related to the XML validator for all clients.
As of August, the cost incurred to date stands at £15,562.44.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,
Prameela
